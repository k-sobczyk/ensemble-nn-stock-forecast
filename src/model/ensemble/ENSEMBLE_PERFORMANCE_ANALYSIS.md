# Analysis of Ensemble Model Performance

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of various ensemble architectures tested for the stock forecasting task across 260 companies. All ensemble results presented are from Optuna hyperparameter-optimized configurations, representing the best achievable performance for each ensemble method and architecture combination.

## Overview of Ensemble Methods

Three types of ensemble methods were evaluated:
1.  **Voting:** A simple yet effective method where the final prediction is the average of the predictions from the constituent models.
2.  **Blending:** A method where a hold-out validation set is used to train a simple meta-model (in this case, a linear model) that learns to combine the predictions of the base models.
3.  **Stacking:** A more complex method similar to blending, but it uses out-of-fold predictions from the base models to train the meta-model, making it more robust and less prone to information leakage.

The performance of these methods across different combinations of base models is summarized below.
